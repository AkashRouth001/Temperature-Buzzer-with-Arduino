# Temperature-Buzzer-with-Arduino
This project uses the LM35 temperature sensor with an Arduino to monitor temperature and trigger a buzzer when a set threshold is exceeded. The Arduino processes data from the sensor, and when the temperature surpasses the limit, the buzzer sounds an alert, ideal for temperature-sensitive environments.
